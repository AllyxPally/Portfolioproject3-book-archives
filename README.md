## Testing

I have tested this project manually by doing the following: 

* Given invalid inputs, any number above 4 will tell the user to enter a valid number.
* Tested the code in local terminal and the mock terminal provided by Code Institute.


### Bugs 

#### Solved bugs

* When i tested the code in the terminal, i noticed that something was wrong with the code, this was
due to a problem within the while loop.

## Credits

* Code Institute for the terminal used for deployment.
